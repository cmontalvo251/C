///Revisions created - 12/10/2020 - Added Loop timer

//Revisions Needed 
//See the following Issue on Github - https://github.com/cmontalvo251/C/issues/3
//Datalogger
//Once we are intialized we start to initialize some things if and only if we need them
//If running on computer import the following
//Rk4 routine including initial conditions and mass properties
//aerodynamic model
//openGL if requested
//Environment
//VehicleÂ 
//Joystick if manual mode
//Sensor block
//Once everything is imported it's time to kick off the main loop which depends on the algorithm.
//My vote is we do it in this order
//Send state vector to openGL if rendering and desktop
//Send state vector via serial if HIL
//Send state vector to sensor routine if desktop
//Render OpenGL if turned on
//Call the sensor block which polls fictitious sensors on desktop
//Read Joystick or Hardcoded guidance commands (skip if HIL and desktop)
//Pass Commands and Measurements to autopilot specific to drone being simulated (skip if HIL and desktop)
//If desktop pass control signals to RK4 routine
//Integrate RK4 1 step If desktop
